In the [DisAI project](https://disai.eu/), the Kempelen Institute of Intelligent Technologies, DFKI, University of Copenhagen and CERTH joined forces to improve  scientific excellence of KInIT in AI and language technologies to fight disinformation.

DFKI, University of Copenhagen and CERTH will be KInIT’s partners and mentors in the project focused exclusively on increasing KInIT’s scientific excellence, expertise and competences.

The R&I ecosystem of Slovakia suffers from a lack of scientific excellence and industry-academia collaboration. Gross Domestic Expenditure on R&I from the private sector in 2020 was 0.5 % of the Slovak GDP, being one of the lowest in the EU. Challenged by the lack of internationalisation, “academic inbreeding” and brain drain (second highest in EU), Slovakia continually ranks on the tail of participation and success rates in EU funding programmes.

The main objectives of the project are improving scientific excellence of KInIT in the selected areas of AI and LT, and strengthening research management and administrative skills and support for excellent research at KInIT. 

We focus on disinformation combating, which we consider one of the most important societal challenges to tackle. We already have a rising research track/record and involvement in international initiatives in the area of information disorders. Strengthening KInIT’s competencies will be achieved by building its capacity in three focus areas: 

Multilingual Language Technologies
Multimodal Natural Language Processing
Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence
