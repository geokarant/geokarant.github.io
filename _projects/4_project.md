Welcome to PROMOTE â€“ Tools for Promoting Tourism Experience!

The tourism sector plays a catalytic role in the development of the national economy and the creation of new jobs. According to data from the Institute of the Association of Greek Tourist Enterprises, tourism in 2015 had a direct and indirect contribution of 26.5% to the creation of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In order to increase the value of the tourist product of the country over its competitors, it is not enough to improve only the infrastructure, e-commerce services, and to intensify the advertising campaigns, but it is necessary to develop innovative applications for the development of tourist experience.

The tourism experience is a multidimensional process to find proper answers to a series of questions: Where should I go? Which sights are worth visiting? Where should I stay? Where to eat? How am I going to have fun?

How can I get there? Responses should aim to increase visitor satisfaction by taking into account his or her preferences, keeping them private, mining useful and suitable information from an enormous amount of subjective experiences recorded in social media or collected from interconnected devices at the rising of the Internet of Things era.
