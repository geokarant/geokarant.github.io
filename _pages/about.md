I am a researcher with the Information Technologies Institute (ITI) / [Centre for Research and Technology Hellas (CERTH)](https://www.certh.gr/root.en.aspx) working at the [Multimedia Knowledge and Social Media Analytics Laboratory (MKLAB)](https://mklab.iti.gr/) Previously, I was working as doctoral researher at the [Signal Processing and Information Analysis](https://aiia.csd.auth.gr/spinal/) (AIIA.SPINAL) R&D group within the [Artificial Intelligence and Information Analysis Laboratory](https://aiia.csd.auth.gr/)  (AIIA Lab). I hold a Diploma and an MSc from School of Engineering (AUTh), an MSc in Informatics(AUTh), and currently I am a PhD candidate in Signal Processing and Infromation Analysis at [Aristotle University of Thessaloniki](https://www.auth.gr/en/). My interests lie in the areas of Deep Learning and Signal Processing, focusing on a broad spectrum of topics, ranging from multimedia forensics and hypergraph-based recommendation systems to media analysis, verification, and retrieval.
