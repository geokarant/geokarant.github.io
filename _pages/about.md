I am a researcher with the [Information Technologies Institute (ITI)](https://www.iti.gr/iti/en/home/) / [Centre for Research and Technology Hellas (CERTH)](https://www.certh.gr/root.en.aspx) working at the [Multimedia Knowledge and Social Media Analytics Laboratory (MKLAB)](https://mklab.iti.gr/) Previously, I was working as doctoral researher at the [Signal Processing and Information Analysis (AIIA.SPINAL)](https://aiia.csd.auth.gr/spinal/)  R&D group within the [Artificial Intelligence and Information Analysis Laboratory (AIIA Lab)] (https://aiia.csd.auth.gr/).

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
